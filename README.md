# bohemeantikwebsite<br>
This is the front-end website I did for the "Boheme Antik" hand painted bags company.<br>
WHAT I USED:<br>
HTML5 - CSS3 - JS - JQUERY<br>
AOS.JS - A little of PHP for the contact form <br>
Adobe Illustrator - Adobe Photoshop.<br>
I also created the logo, made all the graphic retouch and editing for the photos.
